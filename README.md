# Detectr.js (beta) v1.6

Empower web sites and apps design through clever CSS selectors.

This plugin is a very small javascript library which gives you the ability to
write clever and specific CSS rules to refine your website design for each
different browser, platform, device and operating system.

It doesn't has any library dependencies such as: jQuery, Mootools, (...). So,
you can use it alone, or combined with those packages.

## Get started

### 1. Get the source code

Start cloning this repository to your local machine, or just download the
source-code into any folder of your PC. As an open-source, the source-code is
available in its natural format and minified.

### 2. Copy necessary files

Copy the ```detectr.min.js``` (minified) file to any directory of your website
or app. For example:

```
/ (root)
|-- img/
|-- css/
|-- js/
|    |-- detectr.min.js
|-- index.html
```

### 3. Import the library

Import the library in your HTML files.  

Since it is intended to help you create better designs by empower your control
on CSS rules according to used browsers, I strongly recommend you to import
Detectr.js within the HEAD tags.

E.g:

```
<html >
  <head >
    ...
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/detectr.min.js" ></script>
  </head>
  <body >
    ...
  </body>
</html>

```

### 4. Done.

As simple as that. As soon as you complete the 3 steps above and refresh your
site in any browser, you will be able to see that many specific classes names
were added in the HTML tag of your page.

E.g:

```
<html class="webkit chrome chrome40 x32 mac osx osx10_10 js svg" >
  ...
</html>
```
